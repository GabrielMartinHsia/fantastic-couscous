One thing that is wrong here is that we are using the size of the first string as our basis of iteration, without regard to the size of the second. 

1. If the first string is longer than the second, once the index `i` moves past the end of the second string and we try to access v2[i], this is an unknown memory location. Accessing such a memory location can cause undefined behavior. For instance, s1="cats" and s2="cat" could cause such a problem.

2. If the second string is longer than the first, but all of the characters in the string up to this length are the same, it will produce true, even if the second string continues. For example, s1="cat" and s2="cats" will yield true incorrectly.
